# Roadmap

Planned work for KACHIPUN TOURNAMENT, by phase. Checked items are implemented;
unchecked items are open.

## Phase 1 — Core hardening

Correctness and safety issues that affect reliability on a public server.

- [x] **Latency-fair reaction timing** — the *displayed* reaction is
      network-neutral (client click timestamps); win/loss stays
      server-authoritative on arrival time. Spoofed client times are cosmetic.
- [x] **Server-sent PUN window** — each `shoot` event carries `windowMs`; the
      client uses the authoritative, server-determined window for its input
      lock and surfaces `400`/`409` rejections inline instead of silently
      reporting a "Timed out" result.
- [x] **State machine for screen transitions** — pure, table-driven
      `web/machine.js`; invalid edges no-op instead of drifting state. Go
      match phases route through `advance(from, to)` with an explicit edge
      table. Validated by `web/machine.test.cjs` plus Go tests.
- [x] **Mode-aware rematch** — results carry the match `mode`
      (`cpu`/`online`); "Play Again" re-enters the queue (online) or starts the
      next CPU match immediately; "Change mode" returns to the lobby.
- [x] **Phase-aware move validation** — `handleMove` checks `c.match.phase`
      before buffering; rejects with `400` in countdown/done or after the
      deadline.
- [x] **Move channel lifecycle** — stale moves are drained on match end/start
      so a leftover pick never pre-fills the next match.
- [x] **Full-channel drop must error** — a full `c.moves` channel returns
      `409 conflict` instead of `200 {}`.
- [x] **Snapshot phaseDone vs phaseIdle** — `phaseName()` distinguishes `done`
      from `idle` so `snapshot()` can tell "no match" from "match just
      finished".
- [x] **Graceful server shutdown** — signal handling, `http.Server.Shutdown`,
      clean SSE drain.
- [x] **Request timeouts** — `ReadTimeout`/`WriteTimeout`; body size limits via
      `http.MaxBytesReader`.
- [ ] **Rate limiting** — basic per-IP token-bucket or fixed-window limiter on
      POST endpoints.
- [ ] **Resource limits** — cap concurrent clients, active matches, and queue
      length; reject with `503` when full.
- [ ] **Anonymous abuse prevention** — enforce a max number of anonymous
      clients per IP or time window.
- [x] **Deterministic deadline enforcement** — the run loop drains each side's
      channel when the shoot timer fires (`drainPending`), so an on-time tap is
      never dropped by a scheduler coin-flip; moves after the deadline are
      still rejected by `handleMove` (`400 too late`).
- [x] **Ready-handshake countdown** — a two-player match does not start
      KA/CHI until **both** clients advertise readiness (`POST /ready`,
      re-sent every 2s while matched); a stale `matched` reaching a client on
      the result screen routes to a healthy "match found" state. Non-acking
      pairs are cancelled and the survivor(s) re-queued. CPU matches skip the
      handshake. A `shootAt` field in the `shoot` event plus the client's
      clock-skew estimate let the player act for the true remaining server
      window whenever any is left (only a fully closed window shows "Waiting
      for result…").
- [ ] **Latency compensation** — the ready handshake removes the stale/remote
      burst, but one-way delivery latency can still shrink the *effective*
      window for high-latency players: an on-time reaction can be dropped as
      `400 too late` if its HTTP request lands just after the server deadline.
      Revisit a small server-side acceptance grace and/or a `clickedAt`-based
      cutoff once real pings are known (win/loss must stay
      arrival-time-authoritative; see Phase 4 anti-cheat).

## Phase 2 — Testing & observability

Make the system testable and debuggable in production.

- [x] **Timing edge-case tests** — exactly-at-PUN, just-after-PUN,
      at-deadline, and after-deadline boundary cases.
- [x] **Disconnect tests** — `TestPVPDisconnectDuringMatch` disconnects one
      side mid-match and verifies the survivor receives `opponent-left` and
      returns to `state idle`; the client stall-watchdog path is covered by
      the recovery hardening in Phase 1.
- [x] **Simultaneous-move tests** — `TestPVPSimultaneousMove` submits both
      players' moves concurrently and verifies a consistent result with no move
      lost.
- [x] **Game-state transition tests** — `TestAllowedTransitionTable` walks the
      full valid/invalid edge set, with `TestAdvanceRejectsWrongFrom` and
      `TestAdvanceWinsOnlyOnce` covering rejection and idempotency.
- [ ] **CPU determinism hooks** — inject a deterministic clock and move picker
      for automated tests.
- [ ] **Request/response logging** — structured logs for connection,
      matchmaking, match lifecycle, and errors.
- [x] **Automated test workflow** — `make test` target; `go test -race` is not
      runnable on the arm64 Android dev device ("race is not supported on
      android/arm64"), so wire it into CI whenever a suitable host is
      available.

## Phase 3 — Architecture & features

Build on a stable foundation without rewriting the core.

- [x] **Pure game engine** — `round.go`'s `match` no longer touches `Hub`,
      `Client`, or SSE; sides are neutral `matchParty` and the hub wires
      `finish`/`requeue` callbacks back to real clients.
- [ ] **Game-mode architecture** — refactor `run()`/`resolve()` to support
      best-of-N and multi-round modes.
- [ ] **Player names** — defined model for assignment, validation, and display.
- [ ] **Multiple-tab handling** — deduplicate or isolate sessions from the same
      browser.

## Phase 4 — Public features

Features that depend on identity, persistence, or ranking.

- [ ] **Leaderboard** — server-authoritative with anti-cheat (ignore
      client-submitted timestamps for ranking, cap CPU streaks).
- [ ] **Leaderboard identity** — persistent player identity model (account,
      token, or anonymous persistent ID).
- [ ] **Lobby / room architecture** — private room creation, joining,
      discovery, and access control.
- [ ] **Send challenge** — a player creates a match and gets a shareable link
      (`/play?challenge=...` or similar) that any guest can open to join that
      specific match directly, bypassing the global queue; the host side shows
      a waiting + cancel state until the challenger joins.
- [ ] **Tournament model** — bracket/round structure for multi-match
      competition.
- [ ] **Solo campaign** — Mortal Kombat–style tower climbing with progression.
- [ ] **Reconnection (re-evaluate later)** — a match lasts ~3.2s and today a
      TCP drop instantly forfeits via `opponent-left`, with the dropped player
      seeing no result. Options for later: resume a live match plus a short
      (2–3s) forfeit grace, vs. accepting forfeits for such a quick game.
      Revisit once public play shows how often drops actually occur.
- [x] **Random fight backgrounds** — each match picks one of five stages at
      random. Implemented client-side: `app.js` keeps a `BGS` roster and
      `randomizeBg()` sets `--bg-anim`/`--bg-static` on the document (the
      animated WebP plus its reduced-motion static frame), so the stage changes
      between fights with no server round-trip.
